It is home to many important Islamic landmarks, including the Masjid al-Nabawi (the Prophet's Mosque), where Anas ibn Malik is buried.\nAnas ibn Malik was born in the year 690 CE in the city of Mecca, which was then a major center of trade and commerce. He was known for his exceptional memory and his ability to recount the Prophet Muhammad's (peace be upon him) sayings and actions with great accuracy. He was also a skilled poet and storyteller, and his works are still studied and revered by scholars of Islamic history today.\nAfter the Prophet Muhammad's (peace be upon him) death, Anas ibn Malik remained a prominent figure in the Muslim community, serving as a judge and a teacher of Islamic law. He passed away in Medina in the year 715 CE, at the age of 25, and was buried in the Masjid al-Nabawi, where he remains to this day.\nIn conclusion, the city of Medina is the final resting place of Anas ibn Malik, one of the most respected and revered companions of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him).
