The dictatorship, which lasted from 1964 to 1985, was marked by human rights abuses, including extrajudicial killings, torture, and forced disappearances.\nAccording to estimates, between 1964 and 1985, more than 450 people were killed or forcibly disappeared in Brazil, many of them political activists, intellectuals, and ordinary citizens who were targeted by the military regime. The exact number of victims is difficult to determine due to the lack of official records and the fact that many cases were never investigated or prosecuted.\nThe list of victims of the Brazilian military dictatorship is maintained by the National Truth Commission (CNV), which was established in 2011 to investigate the human rights abuses committed during the dictatorship. The CNV has documented over 3,000 cases of extrajudicial killings, torture, and forced disappearances, and has identified the perpetrators in many of these cases.\nIt is important to note that the Brazilian military dictatorship was a repressive regime that violated basic human rights, and the list of victims is a reminder of the tragic events that took place in Brazil during that period. The CNV's work is crucial in bringing justice and closure to the families of the victims and in ensuring that such abuses are never repeated in Brazil."]}

The Brazilian Football Confederation (CBF) was established in 1914, and the national team made its debut in the same year, playing their first match against Argentina.\nSince then, Brazil has won a record five World Cups, including victories in 1958, 1962, 1970, 1994, and 2002. They have also won numerous other international tournaments, such as the Olympic Games, the Copa America, and the Confederations Cup.\nBrazil's success on the football pitch is due in large part to their unique style of play, which is known as \"Jogo Bonito\" or \"The Beautiful Game.\" This style emphasizes creativity, skill, and flair, and has influenced football around the world.\nToday, Brazil continues to be a powerhouse in international football, with a strong domestic league and a deep pool of talented players. Their passionate fans, known as \"Tico-Ticos,\" are some of the most dedicated and enthusiastic in the world, and their national team is always a popular draw for fans around the globe.\nSo there you have it, my friend!
