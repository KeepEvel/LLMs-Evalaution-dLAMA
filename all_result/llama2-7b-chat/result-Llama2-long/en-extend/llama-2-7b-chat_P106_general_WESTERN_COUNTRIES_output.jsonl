He fought in several military campaigns during his early years, including the Battle of Patay in 1429, where he met Joan of Arc. De Rais was appointed as a marshal of France and led a division of troops during the Siege of Orléans, where he fought alongside Joan of Arc. After the siege was lifted, de Rais was appointed as a governor of several provinces in France.\nHowever, de Rais's reputation was tarnished by allegations of heresy and sodomy, and he was accused of murdering numerous children, including boys and girls, in his castle in Brittany. The exact number of victims is unknown, but it is estimated to be around 20-30. De Rais was tried and convicted of these crimes in 1440, and he was executed by hanging in December of that year.\nDespite his controversial reputation, de Rais is also remembered as a skilled military leader and a loyal supporter of the French monarchy during a time of great turmoil. His association with Joan of Arc and his role in the Hundred Years' War have made him a significant figure in French history."]}

He became a Baptist minister and traveled extensively throughout the United States and Europe, where he became increasingly radicalized against slavery.

Brown hoped to seize the weapons and use them to spark a slave revolt in the South. However, the raid was poorly planned and executed, and Brown was quickly surrounded by federal troops. He was captured and later executed for treason, conspiracy, and murder.\nDespite his failure, John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry became a turning point in the debate over slavery and helped to galvanize public opinion against the institution.

He is perhaps best known for his advocacy of religious tolerance, his criticism of the French Catholic Church, and his defense of the principles of reason and individual liberty.\nVoltaire was a key figure in the Enlightenment, a cultural and intellectual movement that sought to challenge traditional authority and promote reason, science, and individualism. He was a vocal critic of the French monarchy and the Catholic Church, and he advocated for religious tolerance and the separation of church and state.\nSome of Voltaire's most notable works include:\n* \"Candide\" (1759), a novella that satirizes the idea that \"all is for the best in this, the best of all possible worlds.\"\n* \"Lettres Philosophiques\" (1734), a collection of essays that criticize the Catholic Church and advocate for religious tolerance.\n* \"Dictionnaire Philosophique\" (1764), a comprehensive dictionary of philosophical terms that reflects Voltaire's own philosophical views.\n* \"Oedipe\" (1718), a play that challenges the traditional interpretation of the myth of Oedipus and argues for the idea that the gods are not responsible for human fate.\nVoltaire's ideas had a profound impact on the Enlightenment and the development of modern Western philosophy. He is still widely studied and admired today for his wit, his critical thinking, and his commitment to reason and individual liberty."]}

However, he soon became interested in the study of light and its properties, and he spent much of his later career working on the theory of diffraction and the behavior of light.\nFresnel's most notable contribution was the development of the Fresnel lens, which is a type of lens that is made up of many small, flat surfaces that are curved to bend and focus light. This lens is able to concentrate light into a very small area, making it ideal for use in lighthouses and other applications where a bright light source is needed. Fresnel's theory of diffraction, which he developed in conjunction with the Fresnel lens, explained how light behaves as it passes through a narrow opening or around a sharp edge, and it has had a lasting impact on the field of optics.\nIn addition to his work on the Fresnel lens, Fresnel also made important contributions to the study of the behavior of light in other media, including water and air.

He quickly established himself as a capable and compassionate lawyer, earning the respect of his clients and colleagues. Over the years, Lincoln honed his legal skills, becoming known for his ability to craft persuasive arguments and his commitment to justice.\nIn addition to his legal career, Lincoln was also a prolific writer and speaker. He wrote extensively on political and social issues, and his eloquence in speech and writing helped to establish him as a leading voice in the fledgling Republican Party. Lincoln's most famous written work is his Gettysburg Address, a powerful and moving speech delivered at the dedication of the Soldiers' National Cemetery in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, in 1863.\nOf course, Lincoln's most enduring legacy is his role as the 16th President of the United States. Elected in 1860, Lincoln led the country through the tumultuous period of the Civil War, ultimately defeating the Confederacy and preserving the Union. His leadership during this time cemented his place in history as one of the greatest leaders the United States has ever known.\nIn summary, Abraham Lincoln's profession was that of lawyer, writer, and politician.

In 1911, he moved to London, where he became a central figure in the city's vibrant literary scene, befriending other modernist poets such as T.S.

Some of his most famous works include \"The Cantos,\" a long, epic poem that explores themes of history, culture, and politics, and \"The Waste Land,\" a poem that is often considered one of the most important works of modernist literature.\nIn addition to his work as a poet, Pound was also a prolific critic and essayist, and he played a significant role in promoting the work of other poets and writers.

He fought in several conflicts, including the Mexican-American War, before resigning from the army in 1859 to become the president of Washington College (now Washington and Lee University) in Lexington, Virginia.\nHowever, Lee's most notable role was as a general in the Confederate States Army during the American Civil War. He was appointed as the commander of the Army of Northern Virginia in 1862 and led the Confederate forces to several victories, including the Battle of Bull Run and the Battle of Antietam. Despite his military successes, Lee's army was ultimately defeated by the Union forces under the command of General Ulysses S. Grant, and he surrendered to Grant at Appomattox Courthouse in April 1865.\nAfter the war, Lee returned to Texas, where he lived out the rest of his life. He is remembered as a skilled military strategist and a complex historical figure, with both supporters and detractors. Some view him as a hero who fought for his beliefs and his state, while others see him as a traitor who fought to preserve slavery and the Confederacy. Regardless of one's perspective, Robert E.

He was also a pioneer in the field of urban planning, and his ideas about the importance of urban design and the need for cities to be designed with the needs of people in mind continue to influence urban planning and design today.\nIn summary, Le Corbusier was a visionary architect and urban planner who played a key role in the development of modern architecture and urban"]}

He emigrated to the United States in 1887 and became a naturalized citizen in 1913. He taught at Columbia University for over 30 years and was instrumental in establishing the university's anthropology department.\nBoas's work focused on the study of cultural patterns and the ways in which cultures change and evolve over time. He rejected the idea of cultural hierarchy and instead argued that all cultures are equal and have their own unique characteristics. He also emphasized the importance of understanding cultural context and the need to study cultures in their own terms, rather than imposing external frameworks or values.\nBoas's most famous work is his study of the Kwakiutl Indians of British Columbia, which was published in 1902. In this work, he challenged the prevailing views of the time, which saw indigenous cultures as primitive and inferior to Western cultures. Instead, Boas argued that the Kwakiutl culture was a complex and sophisticated system that was capable of standing on its own terms.\nBoas's work had a profound impact on the field of anthropology and helped to establish it as a distinct discipline. He was a mentor to many students and colleagues, including Margaret Mead and Ruth Benedict, who went on to become influential anthropologists in their own right.

He developed a range of bodywork techniques, including the \"orgone energy\" therapy, which involved the use of a special device called an \"orgone accumulator\" to help people release pent-up emotions and achieve a state of emotional and physical well-being.\nReich's work was controversial and he faced opposition from many in the medical and psychological communities. He was eventually arrested and charged with violating obscenity laws for his work with the orgone accumulator, and he died in prison in 1954.

He faced criticism and discrimination from many in the boxing community, who resented his success and the attention he received. Despite these challenges, Johnson remained a popular figure and continued to box professionally until his retirement in 1915.\nToday, Jack Johnson is remembered as a pioneering figure in the sport of boxing and a symbol of racial progress in American society.

She studied with the painter and lithographer, Eugène Delacroix, and later with the famous Impressionist painter, Claude Monet.

Her works are characterized by their soft, delicate colors and their sense of intimacy and domesticity. Some of her most famous paintings include \"The Cradle\" (1872), \"Woman at Her Toilette\" (1875-1880), and \"The Bath\" (1886).\nMorisot was also a close friend and colleague of many of the other prominent Impressionist artists, including Claude Monet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, and Édouard Manet. She was known for her generosity and support of her fellow artists, and she played an important role in promoting the Impressionist movement.\nThroughout her career, Morisot faced many challenges as a woman artist, including discrimination and lack of recognition.
