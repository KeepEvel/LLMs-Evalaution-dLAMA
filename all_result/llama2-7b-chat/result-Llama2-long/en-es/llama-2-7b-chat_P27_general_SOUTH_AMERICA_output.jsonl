A person born in Argentina to parents who are Argentine citizens is considered an Argentine citizen, regardless of the country of birth. Similarly, a person born outside of Argentina to an Argentine parent or parents is also considered an Argentine citizen.\nNaturalization is the process by which a non-Argentine citizen becomes an Argentine citizen. To be eligible for naturalization, an applicant must be at least 18 years old, have been a resident in Argentina for at least two years, and have a good moral character. The application process typically involves submitting an application, paying a fee, and passing a language proficiency test in Spanish.\nIt is important to note that changing one's citizenship can have significant legal implications, including loss of existing citizenship and potential tax and social security implications.
