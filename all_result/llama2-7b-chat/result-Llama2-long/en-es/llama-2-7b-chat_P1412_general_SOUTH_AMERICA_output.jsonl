Lampi√£o, the infamous Brazilian bandit, was known to communicate in a variety of languages during his criminal career. However, his primary language of choice was Portuguese, the official language of Brazil.\nLampi√£o was born in the state of Bahia, in the northeastern part of Brazil, and he grew up speaking the local dialect of Portuguese. He later adopted a more standardized form of Portuguese, which he used to communicate with his gang members and other criminals.\nIn addition to Portuguese, Lampi√£o was also known to speak some Spanish, which he learned during his time in the Amazon rainforest, where he often encountered Spanish-speaking smugglers and outlaws. He was also said to have a basic understanding of indigenous languages, such as Tupi and Guarani, which he encountered during his criminal activities in the Amazon.\nDespite his proficiency in multiple languages, Lampi√£o was known to be a fierce and intimidating figure, and his language skills were often used to intimidate and manipulate his enemies. He was a complex and enigmatic figure, and his language abilities were just one aspect of his larger-than-life persona."]}
