The company is accused of paying bribes to politicians and other officials in exchange for lucrative contracts and favors, which has led to widespread corruption and undermined the rule of law in many countries.\nIn Peru, the Odebrecht case has implicated several high-ranking politicians and business leaders, including former President Alejandro Toledo and former President Ollanta Humala, as well as other officials and business leaders.

It was characterized by political instability, protests, and a constitutional crisis in Peru. The crisis was triggered by a series of corruption scandals involving high-ranking government officials, including the then-President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski.\nProtests and demonstrations against the government began in November 2017 and continued throughout 2018, with protesters demanding the resignation of Kuczynski and the dissolution of Congress. In July 2018, the Peruvian Congress voted to impeach Kuczynski, and he was succeeded by Vice President Mart√≠n Vizcarra.\nHowever, the crisis continued under Vizcarra's administration, with protests and demonstrations continuing to occur throughout 2019. In November 2019, Vizcarra dissolved Congress and called for new elections, citing a lack of trust in the legislative body.\nThe Peruvian political crisis was a complex and challenging period in the country's history, marked by political polarization, corruption, and instability. It had significant implications for the country's political and economic stability, and it remains to be seen how the country will recover from this crisis in the coming years."]}

The sanctions prohibited PDVSA from accessing the U.S. financial system and restricted the company's ability to conduct business with U.S. entities.\nCanada also imposed sanctions on Venezuela in 2018, targeting certain Venezuelan officials and freezing their assets in Canada.\nIn Europe, several countries, including the United Kingdom, France, and Germany, have also imposed sanctions on Venezuela in response to the political and economic crisis. These sanctions have included targeted asset freezes and travel bans on certain Venezuelan officials.\nIt is important to note that while these international sanctions have had a significant impact on the Venezuelan economy, they have not been universally adopted by all countries, and some have criticized them as a violation of Venezuela's sovereignty and a breach of international law."]}
