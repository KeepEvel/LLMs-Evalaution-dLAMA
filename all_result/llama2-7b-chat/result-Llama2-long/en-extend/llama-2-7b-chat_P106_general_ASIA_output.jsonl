Kobayashi's embedding theorem: This theorem, proved by Kobayashi in 1972, states that any complex algebraic variety can be embedded in a complex projective space of the same dimension. This result has had a profound impact on the field of algebraic geometry and has led to significant advances in the study of complex algebraic varieties.\n2. Kobayashi's norm: Kobayashi introduced a new norm on the space of holomorphic functions on a complex algebraic variety, which is now known as the Kobayashi norm. This norm has many useful properties and has been used to study the geometry and topology of complex algebraic varieties.\n3. Kobayashi's work on modular forms: Kobayashi has made important contributions to the study of modular forms, which are functions that are holomorphic on a complex plane and satisfy certain transformation properties. His work in this area has led to a deeper understanding of the arithmetic of modular forms and their connections to other areas of mathematics.\n4. Kobayashi's work on the Hodge conjecture: The Hodge conjecture is a famous problem in algebraic geometry that asks whether a complex algebraic variety can be decomposed into a direct sum of complex subvarieties, each of which is a complex projective space. Kobayashi has made important contributions to the study of this conjecture and has shown that it is true for many important classes of varieties.\nOverall, Takao Kobayashi is a highly respected mathematician who has made significant contributions to many areas of mathematics, including algebraic geometry, complex geometry, and number theory.

He was known for his military prowess and his ability to navigate the complex web of alliances and rivalries that characterized the political landscape of Japan during this period.\nYoshiaki also played a significant role in the cultural and artistic life of Japan during his time as shogun.

Today, Yoyomi is still performed in Japan, although it is not as widely practiced as it once was. However, there are still many dedicated Yoyomi performers and enthusiasts who work to preserve and promote this unique art form.\nSo, to answer your question, Yoyomi is a fascinating and culturally significant profession that involves the art of storytelling and performance in a highly stylized and dramatic manner."]}
